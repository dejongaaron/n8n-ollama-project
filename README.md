# n8n-ollama-project
This is my repository for my n8n-ollama-project.

This project is an n8n server that is doing two news aggregator posts daily on Discord using the llama3 model which is Ollama.
There are some things that I will post later about this project. Working on the workflow automation and having difficulties 
setting it up, currently I need to use the sort option due to getting to much data. Working on the fields that I need like title,
source, and content.

I will post more about this project and will make it a public repository.
